        <p>Greetings, I am Mohamed Zubair, currently in my 3rd year pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering with a captivating specialization in Internet of Things (IoT) at Vellore Institute of Technology.

            I am immensely proud to share that my journey to VIT was made possible through the esteemed STARS (Support The Advancement of Rural Students) Scheme. As a government school student from the Mayiladuthurai district, I secured the top position in my 12th-grade examinations, a feat that led me to this incredible opportunity.
            
            This academic voyage isn't just about me; it's a testament to the potential that resides within rural students. I'm deeply grateful for the STARS Scheme's vision, which bridges educational gaps and empowers talented students like me to excel on a broader stage.
            
            From achieving the pinnacle in my district's 12th-grade rankings to pursuing my passion for technology at VIT, my journey encapsulates the power of perseverance and dedication. Join me as I continue to explore the exciting realms of Computer Science and IoT, determined to make a meaningful impact in the tech-driven world.</p>
